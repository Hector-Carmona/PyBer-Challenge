 - It can be appreciate from the chart, that the urban city has higher fares in comparison with the suburban and rural cities. Since the rural city
 has less numbers of rides and drivers, the fares that can be got by this city are less.

## Summary

- Statements summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
    * The fares in the urban city per driver are lower, so it requires to get a control in the amount of drivers that exists, here the demand is lower than the offer.
      In this specific theme, the offer (amount of drivers) in the urban city is higher than the demand (rides that are requiered)
    * In the rural area, is requiered to include a little more drivers to satisfied the rides, taking into account not to overload the demand because it can cause the 
      opposite and the fares will drop.
    * Suburban city rides and drivers are almost balanced, so it just need to be controlled for getting goog results.
